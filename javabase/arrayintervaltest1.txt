/*
Given an array of intervals where intervals[i] = [start_i, end_i], merge all overlapping intervals, and return an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input.
Example:

Input: intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlap, merge them into [1,6].

Input: intervals = [[1,4],[4,5]]
Output: [[1,5]]
Explanation: Intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are considered overlapping.
Constraints:

    1 <= intervals.length <= 10^4
    intervals[i].length == 2
    0 <= start_i <= end_i <= 10^4

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice. You can return the answer in any order.
Example:

Input: nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9
Output: [0, 1]
